In this step, I created a new script file named navigate.sh and used the Nano editor to add the script content. I learned how to use touch to create a file and nano to edit it. In the script, I included a Bash command (ls -lh) to list files in the directory in a detailed format, and an echo command to print a message explaining what the script does.

In this step, I ran my navigate.sh script successfully. The script displayed a message explaining the action, then listed all files in the current directory in detail. This taught me how to execute a script and interpret file permissions, sizes, and other file details in Linux.

In this step, I added a feature that lets the user navigate to a specified directory. I learned how to use read to take user input, an if statement to check if a directory exists, and cd to change directories. This makes the script more interactive and dynamic.

I learned how to prompt the user with read, use conditional statements to check the response, and modify the ls command with the -a flag to show hidden files. This enhances the functionality by letting the user choose what to display

I learned to use read for user input and ls -lh with a filename to show file details like permissions, size, and last modified date. This adds functionality by letting the user select and inspect individual files.

In this step, I added a go back option for navigation, letting the user type .. to move up one directory. I learned how to use conditional checks with .. to navigate up and cd .. to move back. This makes the script more user-friendly by allowing easier directory navigation.


# Linux File Navigation Script

## Project Overview
This script allows users to navigate directories, list files (including hidden files), view file details, and return to previous directories. Itâ€™s an interactive way to explore file management and directory navigation in Linux.

## Features
- **List Files**: Shows files in the current directory.
- **Navigate Directories**: Allows user to change directories or go back.
- **Show Hidden Files**: Option to display hidden files.
- **View File Details**: Displays information about a specific file.

## Usage
1. Run the script: `./navigate.sh`
2. Follow prompts to navigate directories, view hidden files, and inspect individual file details.

## What I Learned
- Working with Linux commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `chmod`.
- Creating interactive scripts with `read` for user input.
- Using conditional statements to add functionality.

## Example Outputs
- Listing files in the current directory
- Navigating to a new directory
- Showing hidden files
- Viewing details for a specific file
